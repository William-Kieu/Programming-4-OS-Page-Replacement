# Programming-4-OS-Page-Replacement
OS HW for page replacement

This program implements three replacement algorithms: Least Recently Used (LRU), Optimal, and First-In-First-Out (FIFO).

Functionality

Least Recently Used (LRU): This algorithm replaces the page that has not been accessed for the longest time.
Optimal: This algorithm predicts which page will not be used for the longest time in the future and replaces it.
First-In-First-Out (FIFO): This algorithm replaces the oldest page in memory.
The sample runs are hard coded in the source and must be changed manually to manipulate the outputs further.
